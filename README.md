# project-2-cis25

Made by: Arnie Sharma

This project is meant to be a re-creation of the game _Wordle_, but in C++ and through the terminal. Playing the game is actually quite simple, you just click start to compile the repository and then receive 6 guesses to guess a mystery word that's 5 letters. You gague your score by how many guesses it took you to get the right answer.

note: line _150 & 151_ in main.cpp can be commented by putting "//" in front of it to hide the answer.

# how to run this project (reccomended method):
